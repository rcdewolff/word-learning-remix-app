# Word Learning App

I'm creating this webapp with it's goal being to be an assistive tool in learning vocabulary of any language.

It's also a way for me to learn working with Bun, and with Remix.

The tech stack consists of Remix, ESLint for linting and Tailwind CSS for styling. Where it can it relies on Bun, but where necessary it uses Node.
